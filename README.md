# kickstarter-analysis

##Overview of Project: 
The purpose of performing the analysis on the Kickstarter was to uncover trends among the different categories.

##Analysis and Challenges:
I performed the analysis by creating new sheets based on the kickstarter dataset. Through different sheets created on excel containing data we have created pivot tables and pivot charts furthering our understand by using different filters to determine any relationship. Another technique used were boxplot to addresse any outliers. I had issues with the fuction pulling the right data , as well as being able to pick the right categories to add to our table.

##Results:
The conclusions of the Theater Outcomes by Launch is that during May we see the highest success when looking over the course of the following years that was apart of the dataset.

I did have issues with creating the table and i am not confident with my answers however, i will conclude that the Outcomes based on Goals is that. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31675832/135002841-485c3e64-ee09-4471-895e-1ce75514220d.PNG)

Some of the limitations of this dataset were it called for using canceled as a filter option to generate a percentage however, that is not an option the only option is live and i am not nessarary sure what the differences in the multiple outcomes given.

The possible tables and/or graphs that we could create are boxplots, scatterplots or a histogram. Each one has its limitation and it is best to have an idea of what you are looking for or want. This will extermely helpful
